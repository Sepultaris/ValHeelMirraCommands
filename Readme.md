This mod was created by Elorin's Cursed Remains

This is a port of the hardcore mechanics from ValHeel. This mod was created mainly as an exercise so that I could learn how to use the Harmony Mod support system within ACEmulator. And for use on The Derptide server, hence the name.

Thank you to Aquafir for taking the time to answer my questions. And thank you to the ACEmulator team for creating such a great project.
